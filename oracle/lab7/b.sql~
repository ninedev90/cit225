-- Step #4 - You need to write a SELECT statement that returns a data set 
-- that you can subsequently insert into the PRICE table. This is a complex 
-- problem because you must fabricate rows from a base set of rows, and then
-- you must perform mathematical calculations with the CASE statement.

--COLUMN start_date  FORMAT A10  HEADING "START|DATE"
